# Changelog

## [0.2.10] - 2024-12-08

- Update to `libtest-mimic 0.8.1`.
- Update MSRV to Rust 1.72.

## [0.2.9] - 2024-04-25

### Added

Previously, the test functions supported were `fn(&Path) -> Result<()>` and `fn(&Utf8Path) -> Result<()>`. This release adds additional supported functions:

- `fn(&P, String) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>` where `P` is `Path` or `Utf8Path`. If the
  extra `String` parameter is specified, the contents of the file will be loaded and passed in
  as a string (erroring out if that failed).
- `fn(&P, Vec<u8>) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>` where `P` is `Path` or `Utf8Path`. If the
  extra `Vec<u8>` parameter is specified, the contents of the file will be
  loaded and passed in as a `Vec<u8>` (erroring out if that failed).

## [0.2.8] - 2024-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed quadratic performance issue with nextest, where datatest-stable would iterate over the
  entire list of files for each test. Thanks [@zaneduffield](https://github.com/zaneduffield) for
  your first contribution!

## [0.2.7] - 2024-04-21

### Changed

- Switched to the `fancy-regex` crate, which allows for matching against regexes with
  lookahead/behind and backreferences. Thanks [@webbdays](https://github.com/webbdays) for your
  first contribution!
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.66.

## [0.2.6] - 2024-04-09

- Update to `libtest-mimic 0.7.2`, and use the upstream implementation of `ExitCode`.

## [0.2.5] - 2024-04-08

- Exit main via `ExitCode` rather than `std::process::exit()`. This appears to fix coverage on
  Windows.

## [0.2.4] - 2024-04-08

This is a periodic maintenance release.

- Update internal dependency versions, including libtest-mimic to 0.7.0.
- Update "docs (main)" link to the new location at [https://datatest-stable.nexte.st](https://datatest-stable.nexte.st).
- Update MSRV to Rust 1.65.

## [0.2.3] - 2023-08-29

Updated README.

## [0.2.2] - 2023-08-29

### Added

- Restored compatibility with `fn(&Path) -> Result<()>`. The harness now can take either `fn(&Path) -> Result<()>` or `fn(&Utf8Path) -> Result<()>`.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-08-29

### Changed

- The test signature is now `fn(&`[`Utf8Path`]`)` rather than `fn(&Path)`. If necessary, a `Utf8Path` can be converted to a `&Path` with [`.as_ref()`] or [`.as_std_path()`].
- Non-Unicode paths now consistently produce errors. Previously, the treatment of such paths was inconsistent -- they would either be skipped or produce errors.
- Internal dependency update: libtest-mimic updated to version 0.6.1.
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.60.

[`.as_std_path()`]: https://docs.rs/camino/latest/camino/struct.Utf8Path.html#method.as_std_path

## [0.2.0] - 2023-08-29

This version had a publishing issue.

## [0.1.3] - 2022-08-15

### Changed

- Errors are now displayed with the `Debug` implementation, which prints out the full error chain
  with libraries like `anyhow` or `eyre`, rather than the `Display` implementation. Thanks
  [Alex Badics] for your first contribution!
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.58.

### Internal improvements

- datatest-stable now uses libtest-mimic 0.5.2. Thanks [Lukas Kalbertodt] (maintainer of
  libtest-mimic) for your first contribution!

- Repository updated to [nextest-rs/datatest-stable](https://github.com/nextest-rs/datatest-stable).
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.56.

There are no functional changes in this release.
