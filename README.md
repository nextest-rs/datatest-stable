`datatest-stable` is a test harness intended to write *file-driven* or *data-driven* tests,
where individual test case fixtures are specified as files and not as code.

Given:

* a test `my_test` that accepts a path, and optionally the contents as input
* a directory to look for files (test fixtures) in
* a pattern to match files on

`datatest-stable` will call the `my_test` function once per matching file in
the directory. Directory traversals are recursive.

`datatest-stable` works with [cargo nextest](https://nexte.st/), and is part
of the [nextest-rs organization](https://github.com/nextest-rs/) on GitHub.
With nextest, each test case is represented as a separate test, and is run
as a separate process in parallel.

## Usage

1. Configure the test target by setting `harness = false` in `Cargo.toml`:

````toml
[[test]]
name = "<test target name>"
harness = false
````

2. Call the `datatest_stable::harness!` macro as:

````rust,ignore
datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = my_test, root = "path/to/fixtures", pattern = r".*" },
}
````

* `test` - The test function to be executed on each matching input. This function can be one
  of:
  
  * `fn(&Path) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>`
  * `fn(&Utf8Path) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>` ([`Utf8Path`](https://docs.rs/camino/1.1.9/camino/struct.Utf8Path.html) is part of the
    [`camino`](https://docs.rs/camino/1.1.9/camino/index.html) library, and is re-exported here for convenience.)
  * `fn(&P, String) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>` where `P` is `Path` or `Utf8Path`. If the
    extra `String` parameter is specified, the contents of the file will be loaded and passed in
    as a string (erroring out if that failed).
  * `fn(&P, Vec<u8>) -> datatest_stable::Result<()>` where `P` is `Path` or `Utf8Path`. If the
    extra `Vec<u8>` parameter is specified, the contents of the file will be loaded and passed
    in as a `Vec<u8>` (erroring out if that failed).
* `root` - The path to the root directory where the input files (fixtures)
  live. Relative paths are resolved relative to the crate root (the directory where the crate’s
  `Cargo.toml` is located).
  
  `root` is an arbitrary expression that implements
  [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/fmt/trait.Display.html), such as `&str`, or a function call that
  returns a [`Utf8PathBuf`](https://docs.rs/camino/1.1.9/camino/struct.Utf8PathBuf.html).

* `pattern` - a regex used to match against and select each file to be tested. Extended regexes
  with lookaround and backtracking are supported via the [`fancy_regex`](https://docs.rs/fancy-regex/0.14.0/fancy_regex/index.html) crate.
  
  `pattern` is an arbitrary expression that implements [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/fmt/trait.Display.html), such as
  `&str`, or a function call that returns a `String`.

The three parameters can be repeated if you have multiple sets of data-driven tests to be run:

````rust,ignore
datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = testfn1, root = root1, pattern = pattern1 },
    { test = testfn2, root = root2, pattern = pattern2 },
}
````

### Relative and absolute paths

The `pattern` argument is tested against the **relative** path of each file,
**excluding** the `root` prefix – not the absolute path.

The `Path` and `Utf8Path` passed into the test functions are created by
joining `root` to the relative path of the file.

* If `root` is **relative**, the paths passed in are relative to the crate root.
* If `root` is **absolute**, the paths passed in are absolute.

For uniformity, all relative paths use `/` as the path separator,
including on Windows, and all absolute paths use the platform’s native
separator throughout.

### Examples

This is an example test. Use it with `harness = false`.

````rust
use datatest_stable::Utf8Path;
use std::path::Path;

fn my_test(path: &Path) -> datatest_stable::Result<()> {
    // ... write test here

    Ok(())
}

fn my_test_utf8(path: &Utf8Path, contents: String) -> datatest_stable::Result<()> {
    // ... write test here

    Ok(())
}

datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = my_test, root = "path/to/fixtures", pattern = r"^.*\.txt$" },
    { test = my_test_utf8, root = "path/to/fixtures", pattern = r"^.*\.txt$" },
}
````

If `path/to/fixtures` contains a file `foo/bar.txt`, then:

* The pattern `r"^.*/*"` will match `foo/bar.txt`.
* `my_test` and `my_test_utf8` will be called with `"path/to/fixtures/foo/bar.txt"`.

### Embedding directories at compile time

With the `include-dir` feature enabled, you can use the
[`include_dir`](https://docs.rs/include_dir) crate’s [`include_dir!`](https://docs.rs/include_dir_macros/0.7.4/include_dir_macros/macro.include_dir.html) macro.
This allows you to embed directories into the binary at compile time.

This is generally not recommended for rapidly-changing test data, since each
change will force a rebuild. But it can be useful for relatively-unchanging
data suites distributed separately, e.g. on crates.io.

With the `include-dir` feature enabled, you can use:

````rust
// The `include_dir!` macro is re-exported for convenience.
use datatest_stable::include_dir;
use std::path::Path;

fn my_test(path: &Path, contents: Vec<u8>) -> datatest_stable::Result<()> {
    // ... write test here
    Ok(())
}

datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = my_test, root = include_dir!("tests/files"), pattern = r"^.*\.json$" },
}
````

You can also use directories published as `static` items in upstream crates:

````rust
use datatest_stable::{include_dir, Utf8Path};

// In the upstream crate:
pub static FIXTURES: include_dir::Dir<'static> =
    include_dir!("$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/tests/files");

// In your test:
fn my_test(path: &Utf8Path, contents: String) -> datatest_stable::Result<()> {
    // ... write test here
    Ok(())
}

datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = my_test, root = &FIXTURES, pattern = r"^.*\.json$" },
}
````

In this case, the passed-in `Path` and `Utf8Path` are always **relative** to
the root of the included directory. Like elsewhere in `datatest-stable`,
these relative paths always use forward slashes as separators, including on
Windows.

Because the files don’t exist on disk, the test functions must accept their
contents as either a `String` or a `Vec<u8>`. If the argument is not
provided, the harness will panic at runtime.

### Conditionally embedding directories

It is also possible to conditionally include directories at compile time via
a feature flag. For example, you might have an internal-only `testing`
feature that you turn on locally, but users don’t on crates.io. In that
case, you can use:

````rust
use datatest_stable::Utf8Path;

// In the library itself:
pub mod fixtures {
    #[cfg(feature = "testing")]
    pub static FIXTURES: &str = "tests/files";

    #[cfg(not(feature = "testing"))]
    pub static FIXTURES: include_dir::Dir<'static> =
        include_dir::include_dir!("$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/tests/files");
}

// In the test:
fn my_test(path: &Utf8Path, contents: String) -> datatest_stable::Result<()> {
    // ... write test here
    Ok(())
}

datatest_stable::harness! {
    { test = my_test, root = &fixtures::FIXTURES, pattern = r"^inputs/.*$" },
}
````

In this case, note that `path` will be relative to the **crate directory**
(e.g. `tests/files/foo/bar.txt`) if `FIXTURES` is a string, and relative to
the **include directory** (e.g. `foo/bar.txt`) if `FIXTURES` is a
[`Dir`](https://docs.rs/include_dir/0.7.4/include_dir/dir/struct.Dir.html). Your test should be prepared to handle either
case.

## Features

* `include-dir`: Enables the `include_dir!` macro, which allows embedding
  directories at compile time. This feature is disabled by default.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

The minimum supported Rust version is **Rust 1.72**. MSRV bumps may be accompanied by a minor
version update; at any time, Rust versions from at least the last 6 months are supported.
